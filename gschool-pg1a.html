	   	<p class="column column-one">I'm from Colorado. I spent most of my childhood in Fort Morgan and was raised by grandparents and various family members. Fort Morgan is out on the Great Plains and there isn't much there. I learned to entertain myself, appreciate small details, and solitude. I cared for my sick grandmother until she died when I was 12. Childhood.</p>
	   	<p class="column column-two">I went to CU since Boulder seemed like a "liberal" place in Colorado and therefore very different from my hometown but still instate tuition. I graduated with my BFA in 2013. Highlights: I took gaurdianship of my sister when I was 22 and she was 17. My artwork was displayed in the CU Art Museum. I was published Walkabout Creative Arts Journal. And I built a guitar.</p>
	   	<p class="column column-three">After school I worked some different jobs. I had an internship at the DAM. I was a metal fabricator building custom work for houses in Aspen. That was fun overall but not worth destroying my body. Since that I've been a barista at Walnut Cafe. This past summer I took off work and rode my bike from Calgary, CA back to Boulder along dirt roads in the mountains.</p>
