	In the future...I'm going to continue riding my bike everywhere instead of owning a car. I'm going to have a job that's intelectually challenging that doesn't promote big business agendas or destroy my body. I hope to do that by starting a tech co-op within the next five years. If you are unfamiliar with co-ops you can read about them <a href="http://institute.coop/what-worker-cooperative-1" target="_blank">here</a>.
